      <h1>Objavi 2: another FLOSS Manuals publishing system</h1>

      <p>
        FLOSS Manuals books are written and stored as HTML, but are
        converted to PDF and other formats for printing, reading, or
        further processing.  Programs which perform this task are
        called objavi (pronounced "ob-YAH-vee", as if the J was a Y),
        after the Croatian word "objavi!" meaning "publish!".
      </p>

      <p>
        Objavi is free software, distributed under the version 3 or
        greater of the GNU Affero General Public License.  The source is
        available via 
        <a href="http://booki-dev.flossmanuals.net/git?p=objavi2.git">http://booki-dev.flossmanuals.net/git?p=objavi2.git</a>,
        which also contains instructions for cloning the git repository. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For a more detailed description of the software, see the <a
        href="/README.rst">README</a> and <a href="/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
        files.  If you wish to contribute, or even just install
        Objavi, please join the <a
        href="http://lists.flossmanuals.net/listinfo.cgi/tech-flossmanuals.net">FLOSS
        Manuals tech mailing list</a>.

      <p>
        This is the second Objavi, written in 2009 by Douglas Bagnall
        for FLOSS Manuals with support from sesawe.net and Internews.
        It was extended to output epub documents with support from
        the Internet Archive.  The first Objavi was written by
        Aleksandar Erkalovic and Luka Frelih in 2008.
